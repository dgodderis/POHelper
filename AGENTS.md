# AGENTS Instructions

- Follow repository conventions: Python uses type hints and docstrings; JS is ES module style.
- Prefer existing tooling (`uv` for Python deps, `npm` for JS deps/tests).
- Run relevant tests for your changes: `pytest` for API/CRUD, `npm test` for frontend/Vitest.
- Summarize changes and tests in your final response.
- Add docstrings whenever applicable.
- Update `README.md` when behavior, setup, or commands change.
